# Roulette_Console_App
Created a Roulette Console based game in C#.
### Playing Roulette is a very simple game.
  A roulette wheel has 38 bins. Thirty-six bins are numbered from 1 to 36. The last two bins contain 0 and 00. The two zero bins are colored green. The others are colored randomly red and black, 18 of each color. As the wheel spins, a ball is dropped into the wheel. When the wheel stops spinning, the ball comes to rest in one bin. See Figure 1.
### Betting Betting is much more complicated. 
  The following bets can win:
1. Numbers: the number of the bin
2. Evens/Odds: even or odd numbers
3. Reds/Blacks: red or black colored numbers
4. Lows/Highs: low (1 – 18) or high (19 – 38) numbers.
5. Dozens: row thirds, 1 – 12, 13 – 24, 25 – 36
6. Columns: first, second, or third columns
7. Street: rows, e.g., 1/2/3 or 22/23/24
8. 6 Numbers: double rows, e.g., 1/2/3/4/5/6 or 22/23/24/25/26/26
9. Split: at the edge of any two contiguous numbers, e.g., 1/2, 11/14, and 35/36
10. Corner: at the intersection of any four contiguous numbers, e.g., 1/2/4/5, or 23/24/26/27
